# TODO ![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/atom/atom/help-wanted)

**Enhancements**

1. Check credit market (central bank point of view). 
9. Improve/check pricing mechanisms (introduce time estate is available in the market, cost of not owning a house)
12. REMINDER. Validate transport via OD matrices?

**Research and further checks**
0. Check qualification and age. And qualification dynamics
1. After change decision, check if its superlinear. Are distribution of housing prices is similar to the real one? Are we able to reproduce the geographical patters of housing prices? 
2. Check implications of marriage and immigration
4. List endogenous x exogenous mechanisms [doing this]
8. Check workability map visualization for maps that are not full period.

**Final changes**
1. Validate real estate market
2. Validate transport

**Forecasting?**
1. Imagine we would calibrate the model using half of the data: 
    is there anything the model would be able to tell us about the other half? 

**Old Fixes**
1. plotter.plot_firms_diagnosis()

**Validating and checking**
1. How decision on saving or consuming is playing out
