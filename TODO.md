**Enhancements**

1. Check credit market (central bank point of view). 
12. REMINDER. Validate transport via OD matrices?

**Research and further checks**

1. After change decision, check if its superlinear. 
Are distribution of housing prices is similar to the real one? 
Are we able to reproduce the geographical patters of housing prices?
Answer. Not entirely, spatial location favors jobs, rather than preferences/perceptions 


**Future implementations**
1. Make the assets market work for firms (currently, functional for families only)

**Forecasting?**
1. Imagine we would calibrate the model using half of the data: 
    is there anything the model would be able to tell us about the other half? 

**Old Fixes**
1. plotter.plot_firms_diagnosis()
