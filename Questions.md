###Questions

**Real estate and finance**
1. What are the mechanisms of transmission from availability and markets (mortgage/rental) to affordability? [can we measure that? Changes in parameters lead to (dec)increase in prices by how much?]
2. Are houses affordable (cost of mortgage/rental prices)? [percentage of pop. spending less than 30%]
3. How much of your income do you spend with housing: either mortgage or rent? 
4. **How relevant preference for ownership has to be to topple rental cheaper options?** How much do households prefer ownership [can we account for the monetary value of such preference?]? How steady, through a life cycle is this expenditure? How do you adjust to that? 
5. What is the space of profitability [the size of gains comparatively to the other option] for housing owning or renting given specific cities and macroeconomic parameters?
6. What are the cross influences among family arrangements, income and the real estate market and housing prices [description of parameters and average of prices?]?

How to validate?

**Supply and Demand**
1. Given a shock (such as an increase in the rental market), would the people and economics benefit?
2. **Given a shock in demand (increase in availability), what are the magnitude of the results**
2. How much do supply shocks such as migration determine housing prices [correlate size of shock and prices]?

**Housing Policy**
1. ***Should the government subsidize (or regulate) rents?***
2. Should cities be denser (infrastructure, zoning, supply restrictions) [in terms of density parameter vs prices/affordability?]?
3. Are there enough houses (developers/financing/families)?

**Transport** 
1. Can we test congestion and economic influence of private/public choices?
2. Does increase in car ownership changes household spatial locations?
3. What are the benef'its of financing of public transport systems?
4. How transport efficiency affect housing choices?

**Education.**
1. What is the influence of preferences for education investments?

**Theme, topic**: Real Estate.

That are not many studies to systematically study real estate. Specifically those that align **labor, space and finances**!

**Housing intricacies**

1. Multiple uses influence (residential, commercial, rental, ownership, asset)
2. Social housing and ownership (huge literature)
3. Macroeconomic influences (cycles, interest, liquidity)
4. Spatial, structural influence (supply, regulation, preferences, agglomeration and its changes) 
5. Land market, house market 
6. Existing stock and new houses
7. Decision on bonds (selic), stocks (ações) or real estate
8. Maintenance, depreciation 

** How population from different parts of the income distribution react to variations in 
timing and level of real estate interest rates
