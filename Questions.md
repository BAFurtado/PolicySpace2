###Questions

**Real estate and finance**
1. What are the mechanisms of transmission from availability and markets (mortgage/rental) to affordability? [can we measure that? Changes in parameters lead to (dec)increase in prices by how much?]
2. Are houses affordable (cost of mortgage/rental prices)? [percentage of pop. spending less than 30%]
3. How much of your income do you spend with housing: either mortgage or rent? 
4. **How relevant preference for ownership has to be to topple rental cheaper options?** How much do households prefer ownership [can we account for the monetary value of such preference?]? How steady, through a life cycle is this expenditure? How do you adjust to that? 
5. What is the space of profitability [the size of gains comparatively to the other option] for housing owning or renting given specific cities and macroeconomic parameters?
6. What are the cross influences among family arrangements, income and the real estate market and housing prices [description of parameters and average of prices?]?

How to validate?

**Supply and Demand**
1. Given a shock (such as an increase in the rental market), would the people and economics benefit?
2. **Given a shock in demand (increase in availability), what are the magnitude of the results**
2. How much do supply shocks such as migration determine housing prices [correlate size of shock and prices]?

**Housing Policy**
1. ***Should the government subsidize (or regulate) rents?***
2. Should cities be denser (infrastructure, zoning, supply restrictions) [in terms of density parameter vs prices/affordability?]?
3. Are there enough houses (developers/financing/families)?

**Transport** 
1. Can we test congestion and economic influence of private/public choices?
2. Does increase in car ownership changes household spatial locations?
3. What are the benef'its of financing of public transport systems?
4. How transport efficiency affect housing choices?

**Education.**
