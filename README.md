 **FURTADO, Bernardo Alves. PolicySpace: agent-based modeling. IPEA: Brasília, 2018.** 

This was an open agent-based model (ABM) with three markets and a tax scheme that empirically simulates 46 Brazilian
metropolitan regions. Now, we have also **added a credit market, a housing construction scheme and an incipient 
land market mechanism**.

### Major changes

**new BOOK describing changes and processes currently on the make**

1. PolicySpace2 generates data that can be applied at https://github.com/frnsys/transit_demand_model. 
The transit model in turn generates private and public transport routes, visualization and congestion times.
2. Now data is read at the **intraurban** level of 'áreas de ponderação' (census track/block) from IBGE.
3. There is exogenous migration embedded in the model (creating new houses)
4. Exogenous growth of firms
5. Marriage 
6. Better support for plot formats
7. House prices (supply) are included into families' wealth and updated every month
8. Consumption decisions now follow Bielefeld, 2018 and is now a 
"linear function of current and expected future incomes and of financial wealth." In other words, 
"all income in excess of permanent income will be saved and added to financial wealth."
9. Families composition are now sure to have at least one adult. Children are initially distributed randomly.
10. Houses of families whose last member dies are randomly allocated to remaining family members.
11. Interest being now paid on families' savings
12. When no cash available, families can withdraw from savings for consumption (if any at savings) 
up to permanent income
13. Internal clock updated to use datetime
14. Introduced a rental market 
15. Included construction companies endogenous to the model.
16. Financial (mortgage, credit) market structures
17. Included transportation costs on workers' decision on choosing jobs
18. Introduce inheritance (savings).
19. A neighborhood effect (wealth of resident families influence price of houses)
20. Decay effect on prices due to excess of houses on offer 
21. Data updated (from census 2000 to census 2010)
22. Offer decay (time depreciation) implemented
23. Global availability of houses (vacancy) influences prices
24. Neighborhood effects (based on families' wealth) influence prices.
25. Possibility of negotiating house prices below the offer
26. Vacancy size (offer) now impacts willingness to build of construction firms and prices
27. New output analysis

#### How do I get set up?

We recommend using conda  and creating an environment that includes all libraries simultaneously.

First create an environment and install Shapely and GDAL as such:

`conda create --name ps2 python=3.6`

Activate the environmnet

`conda activate ps2`

Then add Shapely from conda-forge channel
 `conda install shapely gdal -c conda-forge`

Then the other packages 
`conda install fiona pandas geopandas numba descartes scipy seaborn pyproj matplotlib six cycler statsmodels joblib scikit-learn flask flask-wtf psutil -c conda-forge`

## How to run the model ##

### Configuration

To locally configure the simulation's parameters, create the following files as needed:

- `conf/run.py` for run-specific options, e.g. `OUTPUT_PATH` for where sim results are saved
- `conf/params.py` for simulation parameters, e.g. `LABOR_MARKET`.

The default options are in `conf/default/`, refer to those for what values can be set.

### Parallelization and multiple runs

These optional arguments are available for all the run commands:

- `-n` or `--runs` to specify how many times to run the simulation.
- `-c` or `--cpus` to specify number of CPUs to use when running multiple times. Use `-1` for all cores (default).

### Running

```
python main.py run
```

Example:

```
python main.py -c 2 -n 10 run
```

#### Sensitivity analysis

Runs simulation over a range of values for a specific parameter. For continuous parameters, the syntax is
`NAME:MIN:MAX:NUMBER_STEPS`. For boolean parameters, just provide the parameter name.
It now also accepts selected "PROCESSING_ACPS-BRASILIA-CAMPINAS-FORTALEZA-BELO HORIZONTE"

Example:

```
python main.py sensitivity ALPHA:0:1:7
```

Will run the simulation once for each value `ALPHA=0`, `ALPHA=0.17`, `ALPHA=0.33`, ... `ALPHA=1`.

Example:

```
python main.py sensitivity WAGE_IGNORE_UNEMPLOYMENT
```

Will run the simulation once for each value `WAGE_IGNORE_UNEMPLOYMENT=True` & `WAGE_IGNORE_UNEMPLOYMENT=False`.

You can also set up multiple sensitivity runs at once.

For example:

```
python main.py sensitivity MARKUP:.05:.15:7 WAGE_IGNORE_UNEMPLOYMENT
```

is equivalent to running the previous two examples in sequence.

For multiple combinations of parameters one may try the following rules

Include first the params, separated by '+', then '*' and then the list of values also '+'
Such as 'param1+param2*1+2*10+20'.
Thus,  producing the dict: {'param1': ['10', '20'], 'param2': ['10', '20']}
```
python main.py sensitivity PRODUCTIVITY_EXPONENT+PRODUCTIVITY_MAGNITUDE_DIVISOR*.3+.4*10+20
```
#### Distributions

Runs simulation over a different distribution combinations: `ALTERNATIVE0: True/False, FPM_DISTRIBUTION: True/False`.

Example:

```
python main.py -n 2 -c 2 distributions
```

#### ACPs

Runs simulation over a different ACPs.

Example:

```
python main.py -n 2 -c 2 acps
```

#### Regenerating plots

You can regenerate plots for a set of runs by using:

```
python main.py make_plots /path/to/output
```

In Windows, make sure to use double quotes " " and backward slashes as in:

```
python main.py make_plots
"..\run__2017-11-01T11_59_59.240250_bh"
```

### Running the web interface

There is a preliminary web interface in development.

To run the server:

```
python main.py web

Then open `localhost:5000` in your browser.
